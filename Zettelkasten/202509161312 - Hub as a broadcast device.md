**Tags**: #networking

## Main Idea  
A network hub is a layer 1 device that repeats incoming electrical signals to all connected ports to broadcast traffic to every device in the network.

---

## Context  
- Operates at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model.
- Predecessor of switches.
- Also known as a "dumb" device.

## Connections  
- [[202509161300 - Switch as layer 2 forwarding device]]

## Expansion  
- Still useful as a teaching tool for illustrating early Ethernet.
