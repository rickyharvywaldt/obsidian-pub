**Tags**: #networking

## Main Idea  
A network switch is a layer 2 device that forwards Ethernet frames based on MAC addresses to enable efficient communication within a local area network (LAN).

---

## Context  
- Networking fundamentals (OSI model).
- CCNA
- Builds on the idea of hubs vs switches.

---

## Connections  
- [[202509161200 â€“ Example Related Note]]

## Expansion  
- Switches maintain a MAC address table or content addressable memory (CAM) table to map ports to devices.
- VLAN-capable switches or managed switches enable segmentation within a LAN.
